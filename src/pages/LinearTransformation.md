# Linear Transformation (React Wrapper)

This page provides a minimal linear transformation visualizer focused on basis vector input.

## Features
- Input two basis vectors (as 2D column vectors).
- See the effect of the basis change on the main figure/canvas in real time.
- No matrix input, no extra vector input, no configuration checkboxes, and no animation controls.

## Usage
- Enter your two basis vectors in the input fields on the right.
- The main figure will update to show the new basis.
- No other controls are present.

## Implementation
- This page is implemented as a React wrapper that displays the Linear-Transformation-main/index.html app in an iframe.
- All logic and UI are handled by the embedded app.
