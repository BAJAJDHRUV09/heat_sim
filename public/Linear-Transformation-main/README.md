# Linear Transformation Visualizer

This is a minimal interactive tool for visualizing the effect of changing the basis in 2D linear algebra.

## Features (Current Version)
- Input two basis vectors (as 2D column vectors).
- See the effect of the basis change on the main figure/canvas in real time.
- No matrix input, no extra vector input, no configuration checkboxes, and no animation controls.
- Clean, focused UI for educational use.

## Usage
1. Enter your two basis vectors in the input fields on the right.
2. The main figure will update to show the new basis.
3. No other controls are present.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- p5.js for visualization
- Bootstrap for layout

## How to Run
- Place the folder in a static web server or in the `public` directory of a React/Vite app.
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or visit the corresponding route in your app.
